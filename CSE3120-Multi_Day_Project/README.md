# CSE3120-Multi_Day_Project

# reflection

Before i started I did very little planning like a flowchart or a uml table. Instead i just dived into it. It first started out fine, until i got 
the part where i needed to find the ship, captain and crew. I first sorted it then serached through the entire list once. It worked up until
I need to encorporate the number of turns it had. I ran into a bunch of issues. Instead i had to reorganize my code so the two condictions (seraching for a 4,5,6 and the true and false statements)
are seperate and i didn't need to sort the list and there was no need for elif statements because my old way of seraching it didn't work with only if
statements. This part of the code took me the longest to create. My two extensions were relativly simple to add, but determining the winner 
with multiple players was kinda annoying. The UML table and the flowchart weren't that bad to do. They just had so many boxes and writing to do.
Overall, i think this multi-day was relativily simple to complete but next time i should do some planning before hand and consider different ways of doing it. Im pretty sure i followed 
the IPO method this time. I am also unsure if I did the flowchart and uml table correctly.
# extensions

My first extension: you can add more then two players to the game (you just enter how many players you want to add)
My second extension: After your third turn and you have already found your loot, you can reroll another dice outside of the two dice you already have to gain more points or lose more points
Although this is gambling, who doesn't want to risk points for more points, risking is what makes different types of games fun
